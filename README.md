* Description *
An IoT innovation made with Arduino in order to facilitate the formation of a bicycle positioning and safety network for use in hotels in order to help make hotel bicycle renting to tourists more convienient and safe for both parties.
This project was made specifically for use at the 2024 Huahin Youth Innovation Competition.


* Components(Prototype) *
All of the components listed are all used with the Arduino microprocessor as this product prototype needs to utilize an Arduino for the microprocessor as per the requisites for the competition.
In truth, the Arduino and its modules will not be the only component that is required for this program to function. As is listed down below, you will see that there are other sections of the product that isn't Arduino.
- Arduino Uno R4
    - NEO 6M GPS (module)
    - GY521 MPU6050 Accelerometer/Gyroscope (module)
    - SIM 800L GSM (module) - NOT CURRENTLY INSTALLRD IN PROTOTYPE
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard
- Button(12x12x5mm)
- Bicycle Water Bottle(used for case)
